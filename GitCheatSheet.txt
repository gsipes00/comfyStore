/* Git Notes
git add . (adds any changes made to the files to the staging area, "." add all files, or you could list the file names without commas)
git commit -m "notes about change* (commits any changes waiting in the staging file to the master)
git push heroku master (not sure what this does, might be a restart, or might be the command to push the changes to the heroku server files, not sure how Heroku manages application files.)
git status (will tell you if there are any changes in the staging file ready to push)
git diff (will show you the changes that are different between the working file and the staging file)
git log (will show you all of the actions, log file)
git init (initializes a folder for Git operations/functionality)
git checkout HEAD filename (restore or undo most recent commit to the working directory)
